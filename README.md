## Project Description

Teaching in both academic and professional environments often involves keeping track of tasks, notes, or lists across multiple platforms, which can quickly become difficult to manage. While there are many note-taking apps available, few offer quick and easy real-time collaboration, offline access, or support for structured lists (like grocery or to-do lists) in a user-friendly mobile format. As a result, group productivity can suffer due to miscommunication, lost information, or delayed updates.

To address this issue, this project involves building a mobile-first application that enables users to create, manage, and share notes and structured lists with others in real time. Whether itâ€™s coordinating grocery lists with family, planning group projects with classmates, or organizing tasks with co-workers, the app supports both private and shared lists. Users receive instant updates when a shared list is edited and can communicate using inline comments. Lists can be tagged, prioritized, and categorized, while offline support ensures notes remain accessible even without a connection. Secure user authentication and cloud storage protect data while allowing access across multiple devices.

The mobile app is built using **React Native**, allowing for deployment on both iOS and Android platforms. **Firebase** is used for authentication, real-time database services, and cloud storage. The UI is styled with **React Native Paper** for a clean and consistent look. For state management, **Redux Toolkit** ensures scalability and performance. Development is carried out using **Visual Studio Code**, with **Expo** streamlining mobile deployment and testing.
